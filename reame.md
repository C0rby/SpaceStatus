# OpenStatus

openstatus.py collects devices in our k4cg-intern wifi
and generates json output into a documentroot
that rezeptionistin can read

# Goals 

at a later point we can also work with the collected
data in a statistical way.

If wanted, we can also specify users and their macadresses
to show individuals being in the room

# Method

At the moment only arp information is used.
for performance reasons nmap scan is deactivated

# Thanks

... to our friends from @b4ckspace, for providing the idea, some of the implementation
and hints.
